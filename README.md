# BabyNames Project

## Project Description

The project contains an n-th order Markov model intended to generate novel names that follow common letter sequences from two text files containing male and female baby names. 

The program prompts the user to select the gender, minimum length of name, maximum length of name, order of the model and the number of names to generate. After this, using the sequenece of letters found in the two text files containing male and female names a Markov model is built. Next, randomly generated names are produced using the transitions of the Markov model. The program also checks to make sure that the names created are novel before it outputs them.
